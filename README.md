# Valcapella and Dwinn UI

Valcapella and Dwinn is a 12,000 word post-apocalyptic epic love story poem I wrote and recorded with music and actors doing the voices, and it was first published in Issue 5 of literary journal The Lifted Brow. Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) wrote this blurb for the inside front cover, next to where the CD was:

"DON’T DO WHAT YOU USUALLY DO when there’s a CD included with a magazine, which is leave it in the little thing. Take this out of the thing and listen to it because it’s an epic of heartbreak and awesomeness, fully acted-out and music-ed, and it demands your attention so just listen to it. What’s wrong with you, if you’re one of the people not listening to it? Are you going to use the excuse of having a traumatic childhood experience with a recording of an epic poem? Or are you just a morally stunted person who does nothing but self-Google and snack? Get ahold of yourself. Take the CD out of the thing. Move one step forward to the heavenly glory available here on Earth instead of eating so many corn chips and scrolling lonesomely down the address book in your phone."
